# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Two-player mode.
- Input validation to ensure moves are made in available positions.
- Displays the updated board after every move.
- Detects win conditions for rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Detects draw conditions when all positions are filled.

- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## How to Run
1. Download or copy the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## How to Play
- The game starts with Player 1 as 'X' and Player 2 as 'O'.
- Players take turns entering a number (1-9) to place their mark on the board.
- The board positions are as follows:
  ```
   1 | 2 | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | 9
  ```
- The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
